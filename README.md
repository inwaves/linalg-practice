# ml-training
---
Hi! I'm Andrei. This is my repo for all things I'm working on currently to do with ML.

I want to contribute to this to:
- keep track of what I've worked on;
- build a diverse repository of models I've implemented so I can reuse and adapt them;
- switch easily between VSCode, JupyterLab and DeepNote (if I need to collaborate);
- wrap my head around git, what goes wrong, how it can be fixed; (it'd of course be of much more value if others were contributing to it, doing pull requests, etc.);x
- test CI with Travis;
